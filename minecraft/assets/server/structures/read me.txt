Notes:
Mineshaft bridges, village paths and support blocks for Village, Nether Fortress, Desert Temple, Witch Hut and Ocean Monument are 1*1*1 structures so they can be edited (1*2*1 for gravel path).
Fixes MC-45489, MC-107558, MC-12918 and MC-108199.
There's ONLY data structure blocks in structures for loot tables seeds, not for mobs/loot tables themselves.
(Block) Entities have almost no NBT, this is to reduce file size, only the required nbt is set. (persistence required, (zombie) villager: profession, shulkers:facing).
Structures will be updated per big update, to reduce the upgrade paths running on them.
All structures now face north (woodland mansions and end cities have been rotated for that reason, beware that the generation doesn't break)

Small changes:
Stone brick slabs and stairs are now used in strongholds, rather than stone slabs and cobblestone stairs for the staircases.
Desert village temples and blacksmiths have sandstone again, instead of cobblestone (only the desert variant (if you want this undone, I can do that again, but the cobblestone ones just look ugly there)).
Folder "endcity" renamed to "end_city".
Igloo and Fossils no longer mentions igloo/fossil in the structure files (was igloo/igloo_bottom, now igloo/bottom).
The Woodland Mansion entrance was missing the right wall, it's now added as the normal walls don't share the same style and makes it look off.
Renamed the Woodland Mansion structure files to something understandable: 1x1_a1 -> room_small1, etc.
Woodland Mansion outside walls and end cities now have structure voids.
Added file mansion/coridor_high_floor, no difference with corridor_floor, other than that it's 3 blocks higher (fixes MC-107594).
