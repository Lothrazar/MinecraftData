Notes:
Blocks in NBT have the blockstates in a Blockstates tag, eg: {id:"minecraft:hopper",Blockstates:{facing:"down"}}
*minecraft:player* = the player who tries to get the achievement
id:"PLAYERNAME" or id:"UUID" for a specific player/uuid, example: id:"Dinnerbone" or id:"61699b2e-d327-4a01-9f1e-0ea8c3f06bc6"
If the data tag has no value (eg. {display:{color}}, it means the tag has to be present, but the value doesn't matter)
Command suggestion: /achievement give|take <achievement> [progress value], so map makers can also add and remove the progress on certain achievements, "like kill these 2 entities in one battle"
Other suggestion: all achievements of the same file are on the same page, new file = new page on the achievements screen.
If value_X are specified for multiple parts of the achievement, all value_X have to succeed for it to achieve value X.
