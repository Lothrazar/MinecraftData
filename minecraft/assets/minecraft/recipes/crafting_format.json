Notes: 
First runs copy_nbt, then the nbt of return and then the nbt of add
When NBT is copied, and a list which already exists is being specified in return, it adds to the end of the list, unless the returned list is empty.
If the same id is found multiple times in the same recipe, it'll apply the function to all of them
